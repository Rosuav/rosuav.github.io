Alice and her Dresses
=====================

[Alice Liddell](https://alice.fandom.com/wiki/Alice_Liddell) wears a different
[dress](https://alice.fandom.com/wiki/Dress) in each part of Wonderland that she
visits, and has some more as DLC. They're all awesome and they're all gorgeous
(well, okay, that might be a matter of opinion - Fleshmaiden says hi), and I've
commissioned a number of artists to create fanart of them. Those artists who
have granted permission for it have their work featured here. There is no
particular order to these and they do not in any way denote a ranking or
prioritization among the dresses, the artists, or anything of the sort. Enjoy
Alice's fashion show, and check out these talented artists!

The dress from the Mysterious East part of the world, as created by [Heartsome_NaNa](https://heartsomenanaart.weebly.com/).
Alice is carrying her iconic Vorpal Blade and is coming at us boldly across a
parchment of Chinese characters, some of which (ÁÅ´) are aflame. Behind her,
elements of Chinese and Japanese design meet in a conglomeration formed by a
British view of the Orient, influenced more by what looks good on a mantle
than what's actually accurate.

Alice's best-recognized Wonderland dress is her classic blue. Any time she
doesn't have a region-specific dress to wear, she'll wear this one, and for
the denoument, there is no dress more appropriate than this one. It's also
the dress she wears in the beautiful Vale of Tears, a place filled with toys
and icons of happiness and fun - including the marble that she's seen riding
on here. She is again holding her iconic Blade, and despite the bloodstains,
she is happy here.
