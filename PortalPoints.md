# The Portal scale of puzzle elegance

In puzzle platformer games, [Portal](https://store.steampowered.com/app/400/Portal/)
and its sequel [Portal 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/620/Portal_2/) stand
iconic, not only for defining a genre, but also for being incredibly beautiful puzzle
games. In commemoration of them, I hereby introduce: the Portal scale of puzzle
elegance. It is based on two ratings, hereby named Aristotles and Mashy Spike Plates.

## Aristotles

An Aristotle commends a puzzle, game, or mechanic for being elegant. It may be a
single magnificent moment, or an ongoing consistency, but either way, you immediately
understand what needs to be done and how to do it.

## Mashy Spike Plates

In contrast, a Mashy Spike Plate denounces a fault or flaw in a game. Those moments
where you just have to guess, or where a single misstep inexplicably punishes you
more than it otherwise would, or a puzzle which just "feels wrong".

Elegant games will score many Aristotles and few Mashy Spike Plates. Inelegant games
will score a number of MSPs, and then most likely be uninstalled out of frustration.

## Caveats

First and foremost, this is a subjective scale, and not everyone will agree with my
ratings. That's fine. The most elegant games will feel more elegant to more people,
but depending on which other games you've played, you may easily find that I am
decrying a "good game" or commending a "bad game". Publish your own ratings, and
let's compare them!

This rating system is based on an assumption of someone's first experience of the
game. Replaying the same game will show different qualities, as you will already
know details of the puzzles, but can take a moment to see otherwise-insignificant
world details.

## Consistency and game design choices

Very few choices in game design are fundamentally wrong. A game should not be
penalized for making different choices; however, each game needs its own internal
consistency. The overall choice does not get awarded any Portal points, but
violating consistency is worth Mashies, and maintaining it to the extent that it
can be depended on is worth Aristotles. Some examples of game design choices:

* Getting stuck
  - "Finger on the quicksave". Save frequently in case you don't like what happens.
  - "Explore, die, reset the test". Expect the game to keep resetting you. Memorize
    the puzzle as built, and replay in your mind what needs to be done.
  - "Never stuck". If you got into that situation by platforming, you can get out
    by platforming, too. Sometimes requires additional return paths or rescue lifts.
  - Hybrid of "die and reset" and "never stuck" - common and effective. It should
    be obvious which locations will kill you (eg the "unsatisfactory, followed by
    death" goo or a drop into a vast abyss, contrasted with falling onto a clearly
    walkable floor).
* Movement
  - How quickly can you move? Can you press Shift to move faster? Can you crouch?
  - If alternate movement forms are a game mechanic, they must be used frequently
    so they are not forgotten.
  - How far can you jump, and does this feel intuitive? Every game has its own
    jump distances (*cough* C&C Renegade *cough*) but being inconsistent is the
    biggest problem.

## What is a point worth?

Points - both Aristotles and Mashies - can be awarded in fractional parts, such as
a quarter of an Aristotle, but normally will not be awarded in multiples for any
individual event (it would take something truly abysmal to be worth two Mashies).

Awards are subjective and open to debate, but here is a sampling of positive and
negative game features or behaviours which would be worth awards. Unless otherwise
stated, examples come from test chambers in Portal (P1) or Portal 2 (P2).

* Mechanic introduction. When box-and-button testing is introduced in T01, there is
  nothing you can do but pick up the box and put it on the button. No confusion, no
  true puzzle, just a fully integrated tutorial for a new mechanic. In T10, flinging
  is introduced, and the first fling you do takes you almost no distance, but shows
  the difference between stepping in and falling in. Both T01 and T10 earn a half Ari
  for cleanly introducing a new mechanic, although in a game with many mechanics, it
  may be simpler to award a single Aristotle across multiple for the consistency.
* Mechanic reuse. A single mechanic can have multiple practical uses, and can even,
  in some cases, be reversed. A hazard can be exploited. A shield can deflect an
  incoming threat, turning it into your own tool.
  - High-Energy Pellets can be redirected using portals, as introduced in their
    tutorial. They can also be blocked by cubes, as clearly introduced with the
    Companion Cube. Then, in that same test chamber, you bounce a pellet into its
    receptacle, in a portal-free zone which forces you to be aware of this function.
  - Relicta and the reversal of Sigma Teleporter. Got a good Portal example??
* Puzzle element visibility. When you explore a test, can you figure out which things
  can be picked up, which places they could be placed, which buttons can be pushed,
  which doors can open, etc? In P1 and P2, buttons that get cubes put on them are
  obvious, large, and extremely inviting. You can pick up trash, but it looks dull
  compared to the actual test elements such as Cubes and Edgeless Safety Cubes. The
  buttons that you frob (Pedestal Buttons) stand up far enough to be obvious, and
  are again painted in vibrant colours.
* Discoverability. Having seen two puzzle elements, how do you figure out that they
  work together? Point-and-click games often fall foul of this one, as a generic
  "combine items" mechanic has quadratic complexity in the number of items in your
  inventory, and puzzle-platformers that allow you to carry items long distances
  can also run into the "wait, where does this thing go now?" problem. Solving this
  may mean restricting the puzzle elements, or making distinctions highly obvious
  (eg a Weighted Storage Cube Receptacle cannot be activated by standing on it).
  - High-Energy Pellet receptacles shine a light onto the opposite wall, highlighting
    the presence of such a receptacle and pinpointing the optimal location for a
    portal.
* Gameplay/story integration. Obviously not applicable if the game has no story, but
  if it does, there should be a clear correlation and integration. Portal 2 has a
  series of challenges designed to get the player character to a particular location,
  followed by a ton of plot and then you go to somewhere else. The tests are crucial
  and the plot is a part of them. Relicta goes further and lampshades the inability
  to disable the tests for the sake of faster traversal.
* Puzzle isolation - the separation of one challenge from another. This can be done
  on multiple levels, starting with an isolation of one test chamber from another.
  - Mostly this is seen by the Material Emancipation Grills, which relieve you of the
    question "Should I have carried a thing from the previous room into here?" by...
    stopping you from carrying a thing from the previous room into here.
  - Within a test, this can also be done by having portallable surfaces not extend
    all the way to the floor, thus forcing you to fall after walking through, and
    therefore being unable to walk back. In a game in which you should never have to
    reload or reset a puzzle ("never-stuck", see above), any time you can move on,
    you can be sure that it is safe and correct to do so.
  - "One-and-done" puzzle elements are an excellent tool here; once something happens,
    it never resets, and it is clear that the actions taken to achieve this need not
    be undone. High-Energy Pellet Receptacles are always one-and-dones.
  - Note that arbitrary boundaries (player clips) can be used elegantly or inelegantly
    (as can most tools). A well-placed player clip can save you many minutes of
    wasted exploration, attempting to get on top of something.
* Mechanic retention. If something is a mechanic, it should always be a mechanic.
  Don't introduce something, then abandon it, only to have it become important again
  much later - that creates a "gotcha".
* Playgrounds for new mechanics. A game should be fun. You aren't here to tediously
  solve puzzles for no benefit. If a new mechanic is cool, let the player try it!
  After obtaining the Dual Portal Device, the player is placed in a room with nearly
  every surface portallable, allowing exploration of portal mirrors, flings, vertical
  alignment of portals, etc, etc.
* Anti-frustration features are not strictly elegances, but can contribute to overall
  puzzle elegance. After some tricky platforming or object manipulation, grant the
  player freedom of movement between the two ends of it, thus deeming the puzzle
  "complete". Can be accomplished very effectively with one-and-done frobbables (eg
  some Pedestal Buttons permanently activate Vital Apparatus Vents, thus avoiding
  the frustration of repeating the work of reaching the button every time a new cube
  is needed).

## But what if I was just dumb?

If the player fails to notice a mechanic, or fails to figure something out, does that
mean the game is inelegant, or the player was dumb? "I was just dumb" is not a reason
for negating a Mashy; the game should be designed to highlight things. A balance must
of course be struck between hand-holding and visibility, but if many players fail to
notice a particular mechanic/element, it's not the players' fault.

Similarly, the effect of triggering something should be obvious. Pushing this button
opens this door. Pointing a laser into that sensor raises that platform. This can be
accomplished in a variety of ways, but if it is not done well, it's not the player's
fault. (Note that occasional "bonus effects" don't conflict with this. If solving a
puzzle allows you to move forward, you should know HOW it allows you to move forward,
but if the same action also stops you from moving backward, it's okay for that to be
more subtle or even completely unannounced.)

## What have games scored?

Games will be tabulated here with their Aris and Mashies as they are completed. I
can't actually rate Portal on its own scale, since I don't have a first-timer's view.

Game                | Aristotles | Mashy Spike Plates
--------------------|------------|-------------------
Relicta - base game | 21         | 3.5
Relicta - Ice Queen | +6.5       | +1.5
Relicta - Aegir Gig | +3         | +1
