Ever had the realization that the world just doesn't fit your expectations?
Yeah, same, very same. In fact, in 2025, there were quite a few times when I
remarked "Well, **that** wasn't on my bingo card for this year". So as we move into
the new year, I'm building up a bingo card of all the things I expect to see,
and on the 'back' of the card, I'll be writing all the things that *weren't* on
it, but which actually happened.

So without further ado, here is my bingo card for the year 2026.

## Front of card

Predictions for 2026. Some of these are things that I would LIKE to see happen
but don't really expect; others are things that I really hope won't happen, but
are sadly quite likely.

   B  |   I   |   N   |   G   |   O
------|-------|-------|-------|-------
1. Hype Emotes | 16. AI slop | 31. HL3 | 46. APNG emotes | 61. Chrome 0-day
2. DNS outage | 17. Cheaper RAM | 32. Vibe game | 47. Twitch quotes | 62. Starship orbit
3. Retain DST | 18. Satellite collision | FREE | 48. Alice movie | 63. Top indie game
4. Satisfactory | 19. Gilmour Space | 34. Spiffing LLM | 49. Moon fall-over | 64. 3D printed food
5. New Linux | 20. IPv6 adoption | 35. New emoji | 50. Good live-action remake | 65. $1M for KSA

1. Twitch will release a new vertical stripe of five [Hype Train](https://mustardmine.com/checklist) emotes.
2. There will be a significant internet outage, and it will be blamed on DNS.
3. The US discusses abandoning Daylight Saving Time, but doesn't.
4. The 1.2 release of Satisfactory brings a feature not a single analyst predicted.
5. A new distribution of Linux is announced, with much fanfare. Most people stick with the famous ones though.
16. We'll see AI slop appear in a place we didn't expect it. And it will be just as bad.
17. DDR5 prices will drop to more reasonable levels as production catches up with demand.
18. Two fully-active satellites in orbit will collide.
19. Gilmour Space has a successful launch from Queensland.
20. IPv6 adoption: IPv6 becomes available to 25% of home users worldwide.
31. Half Life 3 released. Not gonna happen but let's dream.
32. Vibe game: A 100% vibe-coded AAA game is released, but sales don't even cover the marketing budget.
33. Twitch breaks something and causes outages. Almost a non-event.
34. The Spiffing Brit proves that LLMs are perfectly balanced with no exploits.
35. The Unicode Consortium approves a set of new emoji, and the world largely ignores them.
46. Twitch adds support for APNG animated emotes

48. A new Alice in Wonderland movie is released
49. A probe is sent to the moon, and lands sideways :(
50. Something originally animated gets a live-action remake, and it's actually good.
61. A critical zero-day exploit in Google Chrome causes major panic.
62. SpaceX Starship achieves orbit.
63. An indie game becomes the most-viewed Twitch category and not just on launch date.
64. A company markets 3D printed food to the very laziest of gamers.
